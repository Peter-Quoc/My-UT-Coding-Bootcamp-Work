						Born and raised in Houston, I grew up in the Cypress area. I graduated from Cypress Ridge High School in 2008. From there, I enrolled at UH at the College of Architecture. After studying for 3 years, I decided to pursue a new career. I went from major to major until I ended up in Computer Information System (CIS). As I was studying, I became fascinated with coding and wanted a faster way to learn from experienced people in the field. I found the UT Houston Coding Boot Camp and quickly enrolled.

						A little about my personal life, I am 100% Vietnamese. I can speak, read, and write in the language fluently. I have 4 older brothers each in their own respective careers. I am a cradle Catholic and help out at my parish on the weekends as a catechist teacher.
